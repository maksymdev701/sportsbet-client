              <p className="mb-6 font-secondary">The Kelce brothers made a splash on Saturday Night Live last night, with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce hosting the show and his older brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce, making a surprise appearance.</p><p className="mb-6 font-secondary">Travis opened the show with a monologue that included a jab at his brother, referencing the Eagles' loss in Super Bowl LVII.</p><p className="mb-6 font-secondary">"Even though his team lost after being up 10 points at half, my brother is really happy for me," Travis said as the camera panned to show Jason offering his best mean mug.</p><p className="mb-6 font-secondary">Jason also made an appearance in a skit involving Travis playing an engaged man running into his ex-girlfriend at a bar.</p><p className="mb-6 font-secondary">"Is this guy bothering you? Do you need me to beat him up, because I definitely could," Jason said.</p><p className="mb-6 font-secondary">Travis is the 12th NFL player or coach to host Saturday Night Live, a list that includes Joe Montana, John Madden, and Tom Brady. Travis seemed comfortable in most of his sketches, which shouldn't come as too much of a shock. In addition to playing himself in the short-lived Showtime comedy Moonbase 8, Travis also once starred in the E! network dating show Catching Kelce.</p><p className="mb-6 font-secondary">Jason also appeared in a pre-filmed NFL commercial parody alongside his brother and Chiefs lineman Creed Humphrey that ended up being cut from the show due to time constraints.</p><p className="mb-6 font-secondary">The Kelce brothers' appearance on Saturday Night Live was a unique moment for the NFL, and a reminder of the bond between the two brothers. Despite the Eagles' loss in the Super Bowl, Jason was still there to support his brother, and the two were able to share a moment in the spotlight.</p><p className="mb-6 font-secondary">Next weekend, Wednesday star Jenna Ortega will host Saturday Night Live. The musical guest will be English pop rock band The 1975. It will be interesting to see if the Kelce brothers make another surprise appearance.</p>
